# No-Escape-VR

My First Game Ever Made! Making games has always been my dream. I am so excited ^_^

The VR version of No_Escape! You need a pico3 headset to actually run this binary :)

The windows version is at [No Escape](https://github.com/Satrpx/No-Escape). It is still under development, but not using git as its source control manager. When the development is over the source code will be there!

This is not a traditional racing game. You can jump over obstacles!

Also, there is an immersive first person mode! you can even see the steering wheel moving!

Have fun!

P.S. If you doesn't have a VR headset, here's what it looks like. ^_^
