# No-Escape-VR

My First Game Ever Made! Making games has always been my dream. I am so excited ^_^

The VR version of No_Escape! You need a pico3 headset to actually run this binary :)

The windows version is at [No Escape](https://github.com/Satrpx/No-Escape). It is still under development, but not using git as its source control manager. When the development is over the source code will be there!

This is not a traditional racing game. You can jump over obstacles!

Also, there is an immersive first person mode! you can even see the steering wheel moving!

Have fun!
